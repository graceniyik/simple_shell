This project were supposed to be worked on in teams like two people but unfortunately my partner were not responding to my texts so i took a decision of requesting to work alone
but it was so difficult because it contains all things we leant months ago about c programming langauge and i hope am gonna get chance to keep moving and complete my 
studies with alx. 

this project was about writing codes in betty style and i tried my best,
